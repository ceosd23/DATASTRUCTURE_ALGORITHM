# DATASTRUCTURE_ALGORITHM
This Repository is built by me to go through my concept of data structure implemented in Java, as most of the time i am able to implement them in c++, but in java its quite different. So it will help me and others too to understand the concepts
For data structure go through data structure file.
To need a basic IO which is simple but fast use the Faster IO
Day to day i will commit changes to this repo so please be patient and if u want to commit some chanegs I am Happy to do so.
